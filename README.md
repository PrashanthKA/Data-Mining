# Data-Mining
Classification &amp; Clustering
-This repo, consists of variety of Data classification algorithms like KNN, Linear Regression method, Centroid method and SVM.
-The algorithms are firther improvised by doing a 5-fold cross validation and finally implementing Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Feature selection as well.
-KMeans algorithm is seperately implemented as a clustering method.
