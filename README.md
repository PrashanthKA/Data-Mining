Classification &amp; Clustering
-This repo, consists of variety of Data classification algorithms like KNN, Linear Regression method, Centroid method and SVM.<br />
-The algorithms are further improvised by doing a 5-fold cross validation and finally implementing Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Feature selection as well. <br />
-KMeans algorithm is seperately implemented as a clustering method.<br /> <br />
Further Details <br />
In a given data-set, 70% of the data are taken as TrainData and the rest
30% is considered as TestData. For Supervised algorithms, Each
classifier is trained with the TrainData, and then the labels are
predicted in the test data, along with the accuracy of the resultant
classification. <br />
Further, few transformations like PCA, LDA and feature selection are
implemented to reduce the data size to be classified, thereby grouping
similar data, and reducing the run time along with improved
classification accuracy. <br />
The Algorithms implemented include KNN, SVM, Centroid method, Linear
Regression and Kmeans clustering. <br />
